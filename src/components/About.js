         <p class="text"> We have created the system of HAPPY CODE to measure customer satisfaction. As part of this, our customers are sent a unique alphanumeric code,
           consisting of 8 characters. We track customer satisfaction by asking the clients to share their happy codes with our agents 
           only if they are generally pleased with our services. Since we are a customer-centric company always prioritizing the success of our clients, the HAPPY CODE program helps us to gauge the customersâ€™ happiness and loyalty in our products or services.</p>
